# About Supernova

Supernova is a native tool aimed to **seamlessly bridge the gap between developers and designers**, allowing designers to create functioning native apps for the first time (not prototypes!), or helping developers cut down the development time by removing the UI work altogether.

Supernova does this by taking care of the **conversion of Sketch designs to native mobile UI**, automating all the steps like component styling or layout work.
